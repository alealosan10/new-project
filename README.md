# LibraryLifeCloud AI: Memory Companion

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

LibraryLifeCloud AI is a digital memory assistant that helps users store, organize, and narrate their life stories. By integrating various data sources, it enables individuals, especially those with memory challenges, to relive important moments and maintain emotional connections. This AI could be developed into an app featuring a library icon, where users interact with a personalized librarian character who guides them to the memory books they seek.

## Background

LibraryLifeCloud AI addresses the challenge of memory decline and the difficulty of managing a vast amount of digital content. This problem is common, particularly among the elderly and individuals with cognitive impairments. My personal motivation stems from a desire to leverage technology to enhance emotional well-being and preserve personal histories.

## How is it used?

LibraryLifeCloud AI is utilized by individuals wanting to manage their digital lives, caregivers assisting loved ones with memory challenges, and therapists using it for therapeutic purposes. It functions in everyday life, continuously collecting data from devices, social media, and other sources.

Users can:
1. Ask the AI for specific memories or events, such as, “Show me my happiest moments from 2022.”
2. Experience a narrated story of their life based on their collected memories.
3. View a geographical map of key life events.
4. Navigate through a virtual library where each book represents a year, with chapters for significant memories. Users can modify or add to these books, allowing for an evolving personal history.

## Data sources and AI methods

LibraryLifeCloud AI collects data from various sources, including:
- Personal devices (smartphones, smartwatches)
- Media (photos, videos from social media or cloud)
- Biometric data (heart rate, stress levels)
- Text and voice conversations

The following AI methods are employed:
1. Natural Language Processing (NLP) for analyzing text and conversation data.
2. Speech Recognition and Generation for narrating memories.
3. Computer Vision for tagging and analyzing photos and videos.
4. Sentiment Analysis for evaluating emotional tone.
5. Machine Learning for memory mapping and identifying patterns.
6. Geographical Mapping to visualize life events interactively.

## Challenges

LibraryLifeCloud AI does not solve all memory-related issues. Limitations include:
- Privacy concerns regarding sensitive personal data.
- Potential bias and inaccuracies in AI interpretation.
- The emotional complexity of human experiences, which may not be fully captured by technology.

## What next?

Future developments could include:
- Enhancements for creating digital legacies that family members can explore after a user's passing.
- AI-driven autobiographies generated from user experiences.
- Virtual reality integration for immersive memory experiences.
- Community sharing features for users to connect through shared memories.

Skills needed for growth include expertise in data security, emotional AI, and user experience design. Assistance from AI developers and mental health professionals would also be valuable.
